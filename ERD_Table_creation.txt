Assignment Instructions: Spreadsheet Creation from ERD
Your assignment is to create a spreadsheet based on the ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) provided for Parch & Posey. Please follow these instructions carefully:

1. Spreadsheet Structure
Each sheet in your spreadsheet should represent one table from the ERD:
accounts
orders
web_events
sales_reps
region
2. Populating the Sheets
Each table/sheet must have at least 10 rows of example data.
Each row should include realistic sample values for every column listed in the ERD.
Primary keys (PK) must be unique for each row.
Foreign keys (FK) should reference valid primary keys from the related tables.
3. Table Details
accounts
Columns: id (PK), name, website, lat, long, primary_poc, sales_rep_id (FK)
orders
Columns: id (PK), account_id (FK), standard_qty, poster_qty, total, standard_amt_usd, gloss_amt_usd, poster_amt_usd, total_amt_usd
web_events
Columns: id (PK), account_id (FK), occurred_at, channel
sales_reps
Columns: id (PK), name, region_id (FK)
region
Columns: id (PK), name
4. Important Notes
Always ensure primary keys are unique and present for every row.
Foreign keys must reference valid entries in the related table (for example, sales_rep_id in accounts should match an id in sales_reps).
Populate each sheet with at least 10 example rows.
Use realistic and consistent data across all tables.
Good luck, and remember: the primary key is your best friend—never forget to include it!
